FlatFinder --- One step closer to your ideal residence

Lots of landlords use an agent but not everyone wants to pay commission. For many landlords renting out properties is their job, so they'd rather put the work in and reap the rewards themselves. Similarly, not all tenants want to rent through an agent and pay the admin fees charged by most - they're happier to rent direct from the landlord.

This application solves this issue, with this the private landlords will also have the same opportunities to advertise as agents. They can simply post advertisement of their flats and also able to view tenants requirements. This application creates the smooth communication system between owners and tenants. Users or members of this application can store their flats payment papers or necessary papers for future use as well.

This application is developed with PHP, Relational Database (MySQL), JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
